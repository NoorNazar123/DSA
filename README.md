w📌 Algorithm vs. Program
🔹 Algorithm
An algorithm is a step-by-step solution plan for a specific problem. It is not dependent on any programming language or system.

✅ Key Features:
1️⃣ Design – Focuses on planning the solution logically.
2️⃣ Domain Knowledge – Requires understanding of the problem.
3️⃣ Any Language – Can be written in plain English, pseudocode, or flowcharts.
4️⃣ No Hardware/Software Needed – It exists as an idea, not an executable file.
5️⃣ Analyzing – Can be analyzed for efficiency before implementation.

🔹 Program
A program is the actual implementation of an algorithm in a specific programming language that can be executed on a computer.

✅ Key Features:
1️⃣ Implementation – Converts the algorithm into working code.
2️⃣ Programmer – Requires coding knowledge to write and debug.
3️⃣ Programming Language Only – Uses languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.
4️⃣ Needs Hardware & Software – Requires a system to compile and run.
5️⃣ Testing & Debugging – Needs testing for errors and optimization.
